Exam 2 Review 
Test format: 

20 multiple-choice  or T/F questions (3 points each)

Naïve Bayes 
	supervised learning
	classification
	often a baseline
	works well with small data
	simple algorithm
	high bias, low variance

	assumes all predictors are INDEPENDENT
	
	Theorem	
		posterior = (likelihood X prior) / marginal
	
	Learns probablity distributions P(Y|X)
	
emphasis on these algorithms: 
	Naïve Bayes 
	SVM
	Decision Trees
	Neural Networks
	Know how they work; 
		special characteristics; 
		bias/variance; 
		regression/classification
