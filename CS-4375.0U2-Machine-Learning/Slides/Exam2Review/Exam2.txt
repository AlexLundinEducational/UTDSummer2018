Test format: 

20 multiple-choice  or T/F questions (3 points each)

Naïve Bayes 
	supervised learning
	classification
	
	often a baseline
	works well with small data
	simple algorithm
	high bias, low variance

	assumes all predictors are INDEPENDENT
	
	Theorem	
		posterior = (likelihood X prior) / marginal
	
	Learns probablity distributions P(Y|X)
	
SVM

	most commonly used for binary classfication
	classification or regression
		kernels = radial or polynomial or linear
	binary classification
	multiclass classification	
	
	wide variety of uses though
	when classes are separated, SVM does better than regression
	
	goal: separate predections with ideal margin
		not too wide
		not too narrow
		
	Instances ON THE MARGIN are support vectors
	


Decision Trees
	can be used for classification or regression
	
	not as accurate as other algorithms
	but highly interpretable

	tend towards high variance, low bias

	Cons
		Cannot make diagonal splits
	Goal
		Minimize RSS within each region
	
	Instead of minimizing RSS within each region, which is infeasable
		count classes of regions
		splits made with metrics of node purity
			entropy, measure of uncertainty in data
			gini index
			
	Entropy
	
		subtractive sum of probablity * log2(probablity)
		red 60% and white 40%
		-0.6 * log2(0.6) - 0.4 * log2(0.4)	
			
	information gain - reduction of uncertainty given a split
		we want max IG
		formulas
			IG = starting entropy – (obsInSplit1/totalObs)(entropy of the split1) - (obsInSplit2/totalObs)(entropy of the split2) ... - (obsInSplitN/totalObs)(entropy of the splitN)

		requires more infromation to describe nodes that are impure
		

		
	Gini
		we want min Gini
		ranges from 0 to .5
		formulas
			Gini = 1 – (obsInSplit1/totalObs)^2 - (obsInSplit2/totalObs)^2 ... - (obsInSplitN/totalObs)^2
	
	Large trees
		overfit
		so we prune
		cross validation
		
	Summary
		linear or logistic often outperforms
		complex relationship, tree better
		radomn forrest and bagging are less interpretable
		DT are non parametric
		
Neural Networks
	Perceptron
		supervised learning
		binary classification
		
		linear function based on features and weights
			steps:
			represent the features and weights as vectors
			calculate the dot product
			convert real output to a binary output
			
		Limited to OR
		Need elispe to do AND
		
	Multilayer Perceptron
		Multiclass classfication
		Predicting multidimensional output for regression
		
		Training
			Backpropogration
				applies gradient descent to casecade the weights
			observe errors in the outputs
			Steps:
				output of Feed-forward NN is compared against desired output
					using loss function
				an error is calculated for each neurons
				error is propogated back to the neurons at the previous level
				
			after, neurons can regonize "noise" in inputs and ingore them
			
		Too few hidden nodes underfits
		Too many hidden overfits
			Node choices
			• between 1 and the number of predictors
			• two-thirds of the input layer size plus the size of the output layer
			• < twice the input layer size
			
		Performs better on scaled predictors and untouched target
	
	Neural networks are defined by these properties:
	• the network architecture or topology 
		- the number of neurons in the model
		- number of layers
	• the activation function which transforms the inputs to an output 
		-the sigmoid function is commonly used
	• the training algorithm

	
	• backpropagation
	• epoch
	• neuron or node
	• perceptron
	• activation function

emphasis on these algorithms: 
	Naïve Bayes 
	SVM
	Decision Trees
	Neural Networks
	Know how they work; 
		special characteristics; 
		bias/variance; 
		regression/classification


		
		
		
10 multiple-choice or T/F calculation questions (4 points each)
discriminative
	classification tasks
	logistic regression
	qualitative
	classification
	does not care about how the data was generated, it simply categorizes a given signal.

generative
	models how the data was generated in order to categorize a signal. 
	It asks the question: based on my generation assumptions, which category is most likely to generate this signal?
	quantitative
	regression
	
Terminology and Concepts:
-	bias and variance
-	discriminative v. generative classifier
-	regression, classification
-	entropy, information gain, entropy and how to calculate them (formulas provided)
