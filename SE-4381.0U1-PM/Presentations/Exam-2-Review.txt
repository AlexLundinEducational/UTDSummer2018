		–constructive cost model
		-23 factors
		-within 20% of estimations
		-Factors
			+PM is in terms of person months
			+A is constant that can be modified on a company by company basis
			+size is in thousands of lines of code
			+E is calculate from B + 0.01 + sum of scaling factors
			+B is 0.91
			+big pie Π is the product of factors, aka multiplicative sum
			+weird e Σ is the sum of factors, aka add all them up
