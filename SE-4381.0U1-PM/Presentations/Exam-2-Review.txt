06-Estimating
	Top down
		Based on experience
		Strategic decision making
		High Uncertainty
		Internal Small Project
		Unstable Scope
	Bottom up
		Task oriented
		Cost and time focused
		Fixed price contract
		Customer wants details

	Guidelines for Estimating Workpackages
	1 Responsibility (estimates done by people with most framiliar with the work)
	2 Use several people (Delphi to aggregate judgments)
	3 Normal Conditions
	4 Consistent Time units
	5 Independence
	6 Contingencies (don't add fluff, be accurate)
	7 Risk assessment (avoid suprises to stakeholders)

	Types of Costs
		Direct costs
			labor
			materials
			equipment
			other
		Direct project overhead costs
			-project managers salary
		General and administrative (G&A) 
			-organizational costs not directly linked to project
		
	Zero Based Budgeting
		Make a list of features
		Prioritize
		Write down cost and schedule of each
		When you run out of resources, draw line under last feature
	
	SLIM
		-Larry Putnam
		-Critical Path, aka Traditional
		-Sweet spot, of 130% of the minimum schedule will optomize the project
			+E-effot
			+B-constant
			+Size-thousand lines of code
		
	
	COCOMO 
		–constructive cost model
		-23 factors
		-within 20% of estimations
		-Factors
			+PM is in terms of person months
			+A is constant that can be modified on a company by company basis
			+size is in thousands of lines of code
			+E is calculate from B + 0.01 + sum of scaling factors
			+B is 0.91
			+big pie Π is the product of factors, aka multiplicative sum
			+weird e Σ is the sum of factors, aka add all them up
			+Don't make 2nd and 3rd level assumptions based on facts given
			+Just use what is stated, NO ASSUMPTIONS
	TPS
	
	PERT
			-Uses 3 estimates for each activity in project network
			-Weighted average activity time = (optimistic estimate + 4 * most likely estimate + pessimistic estimate) / 6
	
07-Plan Activity Network
	Critical Path - longest path through, no slack
	Activity - an element that consumes time, built from WBS
	Path - sequence of connected, dependent activities
	Event - point in time when activity is started or completed
	Merge activity - more than one preceding activity
	Burst activity - one or more activity following
	Parallel activity - can take place at any time
	Slack - the amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying anything else
	Lag - minimum amount of delay an activity can be delayed before starting
	
	Project Networks
		+plan, schedule and monitor progress
		+activities, logical sequences, interdependencies, time
		+basis for scheduling labor and equipment
	
	Laddering - breaking activity into overlapping segments
		+continuous lengthly activities
	
	Types of Lags
		-Finish-to-Start
			+waiting for concrete to cure
			+the delay separates tasks	
		-Finish-to-finish
			+testing can only be completed after the design is completed finished
			+no way to complete testing before completing design
			+the delay overlaps tasks
		
	Colburn
		+paying for information with time?
		
	Concurrent Engineering
		- crossfunctional teams cooperate
		- better, cheaper, faster products
		- increase manufactuing team's role in dev processes
		- focus on customer during dev processes
		- use lead time as source of competitive adv
		
	Planning fallacy
		- inside view vs outside view
		- reference class forcasting
		
08-Managing Risk
	Risk exposure
		-expected value
		-probability of risk happeneing * the dollar impact of the risk
