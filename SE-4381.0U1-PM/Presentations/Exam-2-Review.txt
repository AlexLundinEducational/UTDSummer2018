06-Estimating
	Top down
		Based on experience
		Strategic decision making
		High Uncertainty
		Internal Small Project
		Unstable Scope
	Bottom up
		Task oriented
		Cost and time focused
		Fixed price contract
		Customer wants details

	Guidelines for Estimating Workpackages
	1 Responsibility (estimates done by people with most framiliar with the work)
	2 Use several people (Delphi to aggregate judgments)
	3 Normal Conditions
	4 Consistent Time units
	5 Independence
	6 Contingencies (don't add fluff, be accurate)
	7 Risk assessment (avoid suprises to stakeholders)

	Types of Costs
		Direct costs
			labor
			materials
			equipment
			other
		Direct project overhead costs
			-project managers salary
		General and administrative (G&A) 
			-organizational costs not directly linked to project
		
	Zero Based Budgeting
		Make a list of features
		Prioritize
		Write down cost and schedule of each
		When you run out of resources, draw line under last feature
	
	SLIM
		-Larry Putnam
		-Critical Path, aka Traditional
		-Sweet spot, of 130% of the minimum schedule will optomize the project
			+E-effot
			+B-constant
			+Size-thousand lines of code
		
	
	COCOMO 
		–constructive cost model
		-23 factors
		-within 20% of estimations
		-Factors
			+PM is in terms of person months
			+A is constant that can be modified on a company by company basis
			+size is in thousands of lines of code
			+E is calculate from B + 0.01 + sum of scaling factors
			+B is 0.91
			+big pie Π is the product of factors, aka multiplicative sum
			+weird e Σ is the sum of factors, aka add all them up
			+Don't make 2nd and 3rd level assumptions based on facts given
			+Just use what is stated, NO ASSUMPTIONS
	TPS
	
	PERT
			-Uses 3 estimates for each activity in project network
			-Weighted average activity time = (optimistic estimate + 4 * most likely estimate + pessimistic estimate) / 6
