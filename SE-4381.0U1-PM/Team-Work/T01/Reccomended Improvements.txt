Overall think we did pretty well on the presentation, some notes for next presentation:
-think we need to communicate with each other on who is covering which section a bit more and probably earlier
-practice the lines for each slide some more, want to avoid filler words like "um" "er" or "uh" and make sure you know the facts
-we made a mistake of using a windows vista graphic when vista mentioned was a different system, 
	need to make sure we check each others work and don't let misunderstandings like that show on the next presentation. 
-we need to include our team 3 on the title slide

We can start working together on the paper for the next team assignment this weekend to have more time planning it out and drafting
