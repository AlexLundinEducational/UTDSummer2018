Ch3 Reading (168-216)
	Switching
		function of network layer
		
	Datagram
		connectionless
		forwaring table
		each message contains full dest address
		Pros
			packets sent independently (might take different routes)
			link death might not effect delivery
			host can send a message anywhere anytime
		Cons
			difficult to maintain routing table
			not sure if path is possible
			
	Virtual Circuit
		Each entry in the VC table
			VCI which uniquley ID's the connection at the switch
				this is carrried in packet headers which belong to this connection
			incomming interface for packets entering
			outgoing interface for packets leaving
			potentially different VCI for outgoing
		
		PVC
			permanenet, requires admin
			admin chooses VCI and interface values for all nodes in the table
			
		SVC
			signal, does not require admin
			
		Pros
			reduced packet overhead
			firm acknowledgement of possible path
		Cons	
			requires setup phase (at lteast one RRT)
			link failures require tear down
			
	Source routing(179)
		Packet contains header with output port for each switch
		The switch reads header, and sends packets to output port
		Switch rotates header for next switch
		Strict - specificy path
		Loose - specify nodes only 
		
		Pros
			Message can find it's way back

		Cons
			Same problem as maintaining a fwding table
			No consistent packet header size, since paths are diff lengths
	
	Bridges and LAN switches
		Bridge 
			- node that connects two ethernet networks (called extended LANS after bridging happens)
			- promiscuous mode, forwards all messages
			
		Learning Bridges
			Each bridge stores it's own forwarding table
			check source of all messages arriving on a port
				now bridge knows not to fwd messages from that source to that port
		Spanning tree
			Each bridge has unique ID
				elect bridge with smallest ID as root
				
			Root always fwd all frames
			
			Each bridge 
				computes shortest path to root
				notes what ports are used on the path
				marks its perfered port
				
			Each LAN	
				elects a bridge to forward msg to root
					closest to root
					then lowest ID
					
		Broadcast and multicast
