Ch3 Reading (168-216)
	Switching
		function of network layer
		
	Datagram
		connectionless
		forwaring table
		each message contains full dest address
		Pros
			packets sent independently (might take different routes)
			link death might not effect delivery
			host can send a message anywhere anytime
		Cons
			difficult to maintain routing table
			not sure if path is possible
			
	Virtual Circuit
		Each entry in the VC table
			VCI which uniquley ID's the connection at the switch
				this is carrried in packet headers which belong to this connection
			incomming interface for packets entering
			outgoing interface for packets leaving
			potentially different VCI for outgoing
		
		PVC
			permanenet, requires admin
			admin chooses VCI and interface values for all nodes in the table
			
		SVC
			signal, does not require admin
			
		Pros
			reduced packet overhead
			firm acknowledgement of possible path
		Cons	
			requires setup phase (at lteast one RRT)
			link failures require tear down
