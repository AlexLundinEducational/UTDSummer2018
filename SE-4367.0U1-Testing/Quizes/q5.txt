public Set intersection (Set s1, Set s2)

      // Effects:   If s1 or s2 is null throw NullPointerException
   //     else return a (non null) Set equal to the intersection
  //     of Sets s1 and s2

   Characteristic:  Validity of s1       
       - s1 = null  
       - s1 = {}        
       - s1 has at least one element
   
   Characteristic:  Relation between s1 and s2       
       - s1 and s2 represent the same set       
       - s1 is a subset of s2       
       - s2 is a subset of s1  
       - s1 and s2 do not have any elements in common 

My notes:
	s1 == s2
	s2 subsumes s1
	s1 subsumes s2
	s1 is disjoint from s2
My Definitions:
	disjoint - uncomplete partition

(a)  Does the partition “Validity of s1” satisfy the completeness property? 
If not, give a value for s1 that does not fit in any block.
Yes, this covers the completeness property of the s1 argument.


(b)  Does the partition “Validity of s1” satisfy the disjointness property? 
If not, give a value for s1 that fits in more than one block.
Yes, this covers the disjointness property. 
A null object is disjoint from a empty list which is disjoint from a list with 1 or more elements.


(c)  Does the partition “Relation between s1 and s2” satisfy the completeness property? 
If not, give a pair of values for s1 and s2 that does not fit in any block.
***Yes, this satisfies completeness.
***No, this characteristic doesn't account for stray element's that are shared between set's 

(d)  Does the partition “Relation between s1 and s2” satisfy the disjointness property? 
If not, give a pair of values for s1 and s2 that fits in more than one block.
No, when s1 and s2 represent the same set then s1 is also a subset of s1 and vice versa.


(e)  If the “Base Choice” criterion were applied to the two partitions 
(exactly as written), how many test requirements would result?
7 blocks, so 7 tests per characteristic
49 tests
